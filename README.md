# Autonomous GPS based UAV
 
### Project Goal:
This UAV system is designed to be a dynamic personal storage system which can accompany an individual wherever they go. The goal of this project is to design a UAV which can aid and assist in the transportation of personal items such as phones,keys and minimal tier items.

### Project Hardware RoadMap:

Across all releases there would be iterative UAV body design to allow for higher load capacity.
