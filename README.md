### AUAC
The AUAC system is designed to be a dynamic personal storage system which can accompany an individual wherever they go. The goal of this project is to design a UAV which can aid and assist in the transportation of personal items such as phones,keys and minimal tier items. This project is aimed to be a proof of concept which is not meant to progress past the design stage.
