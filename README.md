### AUAC
The AUAC system is designed to be a dynamic personal storage system which can accompany an individual wherever they go. The goal of this project is to design a UAV which can aid and assist in the transportation of personal items such as phones,keys and minimal tier items. [Detailed Description](https://github.com/nyameaama/Autonomous-UAV/blob/master/docs/description.md)

#### Control 
The AUAC drone runs a closed-loop feedback system. The control system looks at the current output state and alters it to the desired condition with a control action by the system. The feedback system consists of 4 PID controllers for control of pitch, yaw and roll. For more information on tuning. [Link]()
